# Requirements
#
# Description:
#   This file handles dependencies on roles available over at the ansible-galaxy -- because we are devs and kind of lazy so we let other
#   people do all the heavy liffting :] -- jk -- we want to keep things DRY.
#   This resembles the functionality of a packagemanager like apt, npm, cocoaPods or homebrew.
#
#   Install roles by entering the following command into your shell of choice:
#
#     ```
#       cd ./path/to/requirements.yml
#       ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -f
#     ```
#     The -f option is required or else ansible-galaxy won't install roles that are already available.
#     Further information about ansible-galaxy can be obtained from here: https://galaxy.ansible.com/intro
