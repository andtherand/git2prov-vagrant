# This file is used to install the HPC-StateLogger-Backend in on a single host that runs on >> Ubuntu <<.
#
# Description:
#
#   Installs some default packages aswell as setting some basic settings like the timezone.
#   Also installs docker and docker-compose.
#   To be able to connect the sync_gateway with the couchbase-server we needed to merge the two docker-compose files
#   (docker-compose_couchbase_server.yml.j2, docker-compose_couchbase_server.yml.j2) found in files, into one bigger docker-compose file
